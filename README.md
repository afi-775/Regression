# California Housing Regression

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the California Housing dataset to predict median house prices based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, and regression modeling.

## Features
- **Data Loading:** Uses `fetch_california_housing` from `sklearn.datasets`.
- **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and performs feature scaling (standardization, power transformation).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes feature distributions and correlations.
- **Modeling:** Applies regression techniques to predict house prices.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "california_housing_Regression 3.ipynb"
```

3. Follow the steps inside the notebook to preprocess the data and train the model.
